<p>Enjoy this silly static site build from the demo board.</p>

<p>The site has one page for each card on the board, plus this one to serve as a
langing page.</p>

<p>Use the navigation links at the top of the page to get around or use the form
below to search for content. The search is pretty silly but demonstrates a bit
of non-trivial functionality. Click <a href="../../../index.html">here</a> to
return to the main demos landing page.</p>

<div>
  <input type="text" class="site-search" placeholder="Enter 3 or more characters to search!" />

  <ul class="search-results">
    <script type="text/jq-template" id="search-result-tpl">
      <li style="display:none">
        <a href="#">link</a>
      </li>
    </script>
  </ul>

  <p class="no-search-results">
    I've got no search results to show you.
  </p>
</div>
